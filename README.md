# MLBeanBreeding
Application of Machine Learning (ML) for common bean breeding

In this repo I will show some of the possible application of ML algorithms for plant breeding

In the `QTL_mapping` folder I applied feature selection approaches  for identifying SNPs associated with a specific phenotype in a bi-parental population of common bean

In the `Phenotype_prediction` folder I applied regression methods on a dataset of 280 common bean genotypes and tried to predict phenotypes based only on SNPs

In the `script` folder there are scripts with the function I used for data analysis. Especially for selecting the best models for parameter tuning
